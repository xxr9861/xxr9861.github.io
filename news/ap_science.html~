A \"thorough legal review” is underway to determine if the university can comply with the law while ensuring research continues, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Garcia said about two-thirds of the institute's funding comes from grants and donations that are subject to change annually. The university would typically fund the rest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As officials work to understand the law, researchers pursue their projects, gathering in a space where erotic art often adorns the walls of most rooms.

Don't let AIDS stop it,” it reads.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Life-sized Kinsey himself — clad in bowtie, cuffed pants and suit jacket — reposes in a chair just beyond the institute's entrance.

The city also faces threats from earthquakes and sinking soil, but the volcano is the most visible potential danger — and the most closely watched.

Being able to warn of an impending ash cloud is key, because people can take precautions. Unlike earthquakes, warning times can be longer for the volcano and in general the peak is more predictable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a recent day, researcher Paulino Alonso made the rounds, checking the readings at the command center run by Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center, known by its initials as Cenapred. It is a complex task that involves seismographs that measure the volcano's internal trembling, which could indicate hot rock and gas moving up the vents in the peak.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Monitoring gases in nearby springs and at the peak — and wind patterns that help determine where the ash could be blown — also play a role.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The forces inside are so great that they can temporarily deform the peak, so cameras and sensors must monitor the very shape of the volcano.\u003c/p>\u003cp>How do you explain all of this to 25 million non-experts living within a 62-mile (100-kilometer) radius who have grown so used to living near the volcano?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities came up with the simple idea of a volcano “stoplight” with three colors: green for safety, yellow for alert and red for danger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For most of the years since the stoplight was introduced, it has been stuck at some stage of “yellow.” The mountain sometimes quiets down, but not for long. It seldom shoots up molten lava: instead it's more the “explosive” type, showering out hot rocks that tumble down its flanks and emitting bursts of gas and ash.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The center also has monitors in other states; Mexico is a country all too familiar with natural disasters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For example, Mexico’s earthquake early alert system is also based at the command center. Because the city’s soil is so soft — it was built on a former lake bed — a quake hundreds of miles away on the Pacific coast can cause huge destruction in the capital, as happened in 1985 and 2017.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A system of seismic monitors along the coast sends messages that race faster than the quake’s shock waves.

Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues, a member of the Sustainability Network political party and the government's leader in Congress, said the decision deprives people in his home state of Amapa from much-needed development and goes against research conducted in the state, which is closest to the proposed drilling site. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We will gather together all those who want Amapa's sustainable development, so that technically, legally and responsiibly we can fight against this decision,” Rodrigues wrote on Twitter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He announced he would leave the center-left party, of which Environment Minister Marina Silva is a leading member. She appointed Agostinho to lead the environment regulator.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In its statement, Petrobras said it believes it strictly followed all licensing requirements and highlighted that the proposed drilling, in an area known as the Equatorial Margin, was proposed for an area over 500 kilometers (over 300 miles) from the Amazon River's mouth.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The company remains committed to the development of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin, recognizing the importance of new frontiers to ensure the country’s energy security and the resources needed for a fair and sustainable

But the city has spent $21 million doing that over the past decade, and is suing the state to recoup those costs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a letter to the city the DEP cited the emergency nature of the work to be done in explaining why it is now giving permission for it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The permission to repair the dunes represented a victory for North Wildwood, even if it proves short-lived.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“What we have been requesting is so obvious that it would have been ridiculous if they said no again,” said Mayor Patrick Rosenello, a Republican. “For them to finally agree with what we've been saying is certainly satisfying.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The federal government has said a beach replenishment in the Wildwoods would begin 18 to 24 months after all approvals are granted, Rosenello said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Even if we got every approval tomorrow, we're still looking at 2025 at the earliest before we get that project here,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Rosenello said trucks should begin moving sand next week, and predicted the repairs would be complete before Memorial Day weekend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In tangled, ongoing litigation, the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3BBK2V9\">state is suing North Wildwood\u003c/a> for $12 million over previous unapproved beach repairs. The city \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/41OaqFU\">is suing the state\u003c/a> back to recoup the cost of trucking sand onto the eroded beach.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Numerous violation notices issued by the state remain active, including one that involves \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3OnBvg1\">work the city did several years ago\u003c/a> along a section of beachfront that it said had become badly eroded. The state said the work destroyed 8 acres of vegetated dunes, including 6.7 acres of critical wildlife habitat, and 1.1 acres of freshwater wetlands.\u003c/p>\u003cp>North Wildwood built a vinyl and steel bulkhead for about 10 blocks without state approval, saying it needed to act urgently to protect lives and property. That is separate from the latest bulkhead the city wanted to build, but agreed to forego for now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rosenello said the city has reapplied through normal channels for permission to do more extensive beach work instead of seeking emergency approval as it has been since last fall.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at \u003ca

It would put governments and the industry on the spot to comply.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kerry rejected the idea of putting a deadline on phasing out oil and gas production. How fast that can happen depends partly on how fast the world moves to electric vehicles and renewable-fueled power grids, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Instead, he said, this year’s climate talks will “quite possibly” produce an international agreement to phase out the use of “unabated” oil and natural gas, meaning oil and gas where the carbon emissions are not captured. This could disappoint those calling for fast cuts in oil and gas production.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kerry said the deadline to watch is 2030. By then, the U.N.’s top climate panel says, the world will need to have nearly halved climate-damaging emissions to stave off the more devastating scenarios of global warming.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We can’t let the wish or the hope govern common sense here,” Kerry said. “If we know that we can get the job done by deploying more renewables and current technology, we ought to be doing that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>__\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story was first published on May 14, 2023.

Co-founded by Altman in 2015 with backing from tech billionaire Elon Musk, the startup has evolved from a nonprofit research lab with a safety-focused mission into a business.

The New England Fishery Management Council, a regulatory board, has lowered catch limits of the fish in an attempt to halt the overfishing, said agency spokesperson Allison Ferreira.\u003c/p>\u003cp>However, numerous fishers said the assessment doesn't match what they're seeing on the water, where haddock appear to them to be plentiful. And the warning from the federal government arrives as more New England fishers rely on haddock than in previous decades because of the collapse of other seafood species, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-environment-maine-portland-f8475b0cda55e26ef0145e95447b963f\">such as Atlantic cod\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We seem to find plenty, but they can't,” said Terry Alexander, a Maine-based fisher who targets haddock and other species. “It's a disaster is what it is. A total, complete disaster.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The fishery management council mandated the 84% reduction in catch quotas for the current fishing year, which started May 1. The change applies to fishers who harvest haddock from the Gulf of Maine, a body of water off Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Fishers also harvest from Georges Bank, a fishing ground to the east where quotas were also reduced for this year, including adjoining areas overseen by Canadian officials who issued their own major cuts.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Americans are still likely to find haddock available despite the cuts because most of it is imported, according to federal data from 2021. Some countries that export haddock are also cutting quotas this year. But recent announcements of cuts by major exporters like Norway have been much lower than in the Gulf of Maine, and they represent a much larger share of global fish stocks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Declining fish stocks threaten economies, food security and cultures around the world. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/conch-overfishing-saving-food-extinction-bahamas-08c4c37a1a1429636186e046eb92bda1\">more than a third of global fish stocks\u003c/a> are overfished, and the rate of unsustainable fishing is rising. However, seafood species’ health varies significantly from region to region. Some, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lobster-fishing-seafood-climate-change-whales-037ac7ecc70496098552e8660b73efab\">such as American lobster\u003c/a>, have grown in catch volume in recent decades.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. catch of haddock has fluctuated over the past century. In the early 1950s, over 150 million pounds (70 million kilograms) were caught each year. Overfishing caused catches to plummet below a million pounds (450,000 kilograms) per year in the mid-1990s, and rebuilding efforts followed. Over the past few years, catches have ranged from 12 million to 23 million pounds (25 million to 50 million kilograms).\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Haddock are caught by the same fishers who target other bottom-dwelling groundfish species such as cod, pollock and flounders. They are harvested at a much higher volume than any of those fish.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The fish are one of few profitable species on the East Coast said Ben Martens, executive director of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association. He says losing the ability to catch them is a big hardship for the industry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don't think this stock is in trouble, and I think fishermen are in trouble because of that,” Martens

In an effort to drastically reduce the 30-story building's emissions, the owners have installed a maze of twisting pipes and tanks that collect carbon dioxide from the massive, gas-fired boilers in the basement before it goes to the chimney and is released into the air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The goal is to stop that climate-warming gas from entering the atmosphere. And there's a dire need for reducing emissions from skyscrapers like these in such a vertical city. Buildings are by far the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions here, roughly two-thirds, according to the city buildings department. \u003c/p>\u003cp>New York state’s buildings also emit more air pollution than any other state's. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"c5436f1e61a5448885818bccc7723dc2\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>So building owners must make dramatic cuts starting next year or face escalating fines under a new city law. About 50,000 structures — more than half the buildings in the city, are subject to Local Law 97. Other cities such as \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-business-environment-and-nature-boston-environment-44a4127d5551e0d9ae518e3ffd12480b\">Boston\u003c/a> and Denver followed suit with similar rules.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As a result, property managers are scrambling to change how their buildings operate. Some are installing carbon capture systems, which strip out carbon dioxide, direct it into tanks and prepare it for sale to other companies to make carbonated beverages, soap or concrete.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They see it as a way to meet emissions goals without having to relocate residents for extensive renovations. In this case, the carbon dioxide is sold to a concrete manufacturer in Brooklyn, where it's turned into a mineral and permanently embedded in concrete. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We think the problem is reducing emissions as quickly as possible,\" said Brian Asparro, chief operating officer of CarbonQuest, which built the system. “Time is not on our side, and this type of solution can be installed quickly, cost-effectively and without a major disruption.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"03bb93a0-ed50-11ed-fec9-d1df30ff0beb\" class=\"related-story-embed\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Yet critics, many of them representing environmental groups, say building managers should be going much further: They argue that to achieve meaningful reductions in emissions, buildings should be significantly upgraded and switched to renewable-powered electricity instead of continuing to burn fossil fuels. They also express concerns about the safety of storing large amounts of carbon dioxide, an asphyxiant, in a densely populated community.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Carbon capture doesn’t actually reduce emissions; it seeks to put them somewhere else,” said Anthony Rogers-Wright, director of environmental justice at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest. “The emissions still exist. And we should be clear that the only way to reduce emissions ... is to stop emitting.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s still unclear whether carbon capture technology will even be recognized by New York City as a qualifying emissions reduction; the city has yet to decide. Asparro and others are trying to persuade city officials to accept it.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"7a3119d4a23a49f5b5d12db873ebf011\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>CAPTURING THE CULPRIT\u003c/h2>\u003cp>In the basement of the Upper West Side apartment building, two hulking 500-horsepower boilers rumble, burning natural gas and releasing carbon dioxide. The boilers, which are expected to last another 10 or 20 years, produce roughly half the building's emissions, Asparro said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The other half of the emissions that, in the city's view, the building is responsible for, are those generated at the power plants where the building gets its electricity. The carbon capture system, Asparro said, is trapping about 60% of the boilers' emissions. All told then, including the electricity to power the system, it's reducing the building's emissions by roughly 23%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Boilers like this are installed everywhere, in schools and hospitals around the world,” Asparro said. “It's a really big challenge that buildings are facing in order to reduce emissions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The carbon dioxide and other gases are diverted from the chimney and piped into a room where a few parking spaces have been repurposed to house the carbon capture system. The gases flow over a special material that separates out the carbon dioxide. Then it’s compressed and cooled to minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-23 Celsius), turning it into liquid that's then stored in tanks. That process takes energy, and capturing carbon dioxide does increase the building's electricity use, but overall the system is still reducing the building's emissions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>More pipes lead to spigots outside the building, where a truck pulls up once or twice a week to load up with liquefied CO2. The truck carries it through city streets and across a bridge to Brooklyn, where it's sold to a concrete manufacturer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Carbon capture technology has existed on an industrial scale for decades, used by oil and gas companies and some manufacturing plants to capture climate-warming carbon dioxide and either sell it, or use it to wrestle more oil from underground.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But now a handful of green tech companies and building owners are trying for the first time to deploy this technology on a much smaller scale on residential buildings. New York City's law requires buildings exceeding 25,000 square feet to reduce emissions. In Minnesota, Radisson Blu Mall of America, a hotel, has installed a system that captures carbon dioxide that's eventually used to make soap.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"5564c65b6bea46dd8c5103b43fe7aa21\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Building owners that can afford to pay for carbon capture equipment do receive some federal tax breaks for installing the systems. There are other incentives available to help update buildings, according to NYC Accelerator, a program that helps homeowners and property managers find ways to reduce emissions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>To reduce energy use, the apartment building also has computerized motors, fans and pumps, LED lighting and battery storage, said Josh London, senior vice president at Glenwood Management Corp., which manages the building. The company plans to install carbon capture systems in five other buildings this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Without action, similar high-rise buildings could face fines of nearly $1 million annually starting in 2030, Asparro estimated. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly 70% of New York City’s large buildings have steam boilers that run on natural gas or oil, according to NYC Accelerator. Many have heating systems more than a half-century old, and often they’re under-maintained, said Luke Surowiec, director of building decarbonization at ICF, a consulting firm which manages NYC Accelerator.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our buildings are very old and inefficient, and that’s the reality,” Surowiec said. “There are a ton of opportunities that haven’t been realized.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"ec098a8c79c540cea68c0133e9e6eb88\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>MINERALIZING INTO CONCRETE\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Over in Brooklyn, the floor rattles and shakes as yellow machines churn at Glenwood Mason Supply Company Inc., a concrete maker unrelated to Glenwood Management Corp. Grey blocks rattle down a conveyor line under a din of metal gears and motors. Somehow, birds have moved in and fly between towering piles of blocks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s into this clamor that a truck delivers the liquefied carbon dioxide collected at the Manhattan apartment building. Then, using equipment provided \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/general-news-business-technology-science-environment-and-nature-b3f2a4b62368844b30258defa9d9ccb5\">by a company called CarbonCure\u003c/a>, the liquid carbon dioxide is compressed and turned into a solid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As concrete ingredients churn in a structure resembling a pizza oven, the carbon dioxide, now essentially dry ice, flows in like a mist. The carbon dioxide reacts with calcium ions in cement, one of the ingredients of concrete. This forms calcium carbonate, which becomes embedded in the concrete.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Once carbon dioxide is in that mineral state, it's secure and it won't be released unless it's heated to about 900 degrees Celsius (1652 degrees Fahrenheit), said Claire Nelson, a geochemist who specializes in carbon capture at Columbia Climate School.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"7943615590e44e86824071917ab471e4\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“So unless a volcano erupts on top of your concrete building, that carbon is going to be there forever,” Nelson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One main ingredient of concrete is cement, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-china-pollution-3d97642acbb07fca7540edca38448266\">which contributes\u003c/a> about 7% of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, according to a study by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adding mineralized carbon dioxide to concrete can reduce its carbon footprint, though not by much.

So the risks are unknown, but they certainly are apparent.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>There's also a risk of leaks, he said, if a truck transporting carbon dioxide were to get into an accident.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Proponents of carbon capture technology respond that there are safeguards to prevent such scenarios.

(AP) — Deep in a cool, damp cave in Vermont, tens of thousands of furry, chocolate brown creatures stir. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The little brown bats, survivors of a deadly fungus that decimated their population, went into hibernation last fall. Now in early May, they're waking, detaching from their rock wall roosts and making their first tentative flights in search of the moths, beetles and flying aquatic insects they devour.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's here, in deep passages that creep into a Vermont mountain, where scientists found one of the first North American outbreaks of the fungus that causes white nose syndrome. Bat bones litter the cave floor like dry lawn-mower cuttings. Look closer and you'll find tiny skulls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And the bats are still dying.\u003c/p>\u003cp>White nose syndrome is caused by an invasive fungus first found in an upstate New York cave in 2006, a short bat flight from the Dorset, Vermont, colony. The fungus wakes bats from hibernation, sending them into the frigid, winter air in search of food. They die of exposure or starvation because the insect population is too sparse to support them that time of year.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Smaller than a mouse and about the weight of three pennies in the hand, the Dorset bats skitter across the cave walls or cling to one another for warmth. Their health hints that at least some species are adapting to the fungus that has killed millions of their brethren across North America. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“That’s really significant, because it seems to be a stronghold where these bats are mostly surviving and then spreading out throughout New England in the summer,” said Alyssa Bennett, a small mammal biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife. She has studied bats and white nose syndrome for more than a decade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re hoping that it’s a source population for them to recover,” Bennett said as critters flitted and swooped around her.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='0da766dbc7d945818e7379061cce9526' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>It will take time. Little brown bat females birth only one pup a year. And while they can live into their teens or 20s, only 60% to 70% of pups make it beyond their first 12 months, Bennett said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Scientists now estimate that between 70,000 and 90,000 bats hibernate in the Dorset cave, the largest concentration in New England. Their numbers have dwindled from an estimated winter population of 300,000 to 350,000 or more in the 1960s, the last time the location was surveyed before white nose infiltrated.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>It's unclear how far the numbers dropped after the fungus set in, but biologists who visited in 2009 or 2010 noted the ground in front of the cave was carpeted with dead bats.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The fungus that causes white nose syndrome is believed to have been brought to North America from Europe, where bats are apparently accustomed to it. Named for the white, fuzzy spots it produces on noses and other bat body parts, the fungus has killed 90% or more of the bat populations in parts of North America. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last month, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bats-climate-white-nose-syndrome-turbines-d833545cf15b8e7f1c49a916590ccab7\">a report by the North American Bat Conservation Alliance\u003c/a> found that 81 of the 154 known bat species in the United States, Canada and Mexico are at severe risk from white nose infection, climate change and habitat loss. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It matters. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that bats boost U.S. agriculture by $3.7 billion a year by eating crop-destroying insects such as larvae-laying moths, whose offspring bore into corn plants. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Scientists have \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/478b616dbf0540cf9a9409c4e4b07f21\">known for years\u003c/a> that some little brown bats seemed to survive being exposed to the fungus, despite an overall mortality rate that was feared could eradicate them. Though Dorset's little brown bats are holding on, other once common species found with them, like northern long eared or tricolor bats, are almost impossible to detect there now, Bennett said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s something special about those bats,” Bennett said of Dorset's little browns. “We can’t tell exactly what that is, but we have genetic research that we’ve collaborated on that suggests those bats do have factors that are related to hibernation and immune response that are allowing them to tolerate this disease and pass those features on to their young.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Winifred Frick, chief scientist at Bat Conservation International, who has followed white nose syndrome's march across North America, said the fungus has been found in 38 states so far. She says it's a “gut punch” each time she hears of a new outbreak. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Colorado reported its first infected bats earlier this year. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Frick is relieved that bats are beginning to repopulate some areas where carcasses once piled up, even if the rebound is so far only a fraction of earlier numbers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That's a real glimmer of hope,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to Vermont, other areas near where white nose was first discovered also report stable, possibly rising numbers of little brown bats. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pennsylvania lost an estimated 99.9% of its population after white nose struck, said Greg Turner, the state mammal expert for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. While the numbers are still low, they're slowly increasing in some places. One old mine in Blair County had just seven bats in 2016. This year, there were more than 330.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m feeling pretty comfortable,\" Turner said. \"We’re not going to be stuck staring down the barrel of extinction.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>His research shows bats that hibernate at colder temperatures do better against white nose because the fungus grows more slowly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That may mean the bats are less likely to wake up from the irritation it causes, though scientists still don’t understand the mechanism that allows some animals to survive while so many succumb.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“By selecting colder temperatures, they’re helping themselves in two ways, they’re helping themselves preserve fat and preserve their energy and they’re also getting less disease,” Turner said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, there are worrying trends. Pennsylvania's bat population is a tiny fraction of what it was before white nose invaded. In some locations, Turner and his colleagues see more bats, but inexplicably few females. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Virginia, populations have plummeted more than 95%, though the state is starting to see some colonies stabilize or slightly grow their numbers. However, that's happening at only a fraction of the sites once monitored, said Rick Reynolds, a non-game mammal biologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We remain positive, but there is a long road ahead with much uncertainty,” Reynolds said in an email.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Back in Vermont, where temperatures in the Dorset cave fall into the low 40s (around 4.4 degrees Celsius) in winter, the bats seem to have found a sweet spot cold enough to slow growth of the fungus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bennett is working with Laura Kloepper, a bioacoustics expert from the University of New Hampshire, to get a better handle on the population count. Using acoustic modeling, they're working to get a baseline population estimate this year by comparing sound recordings with thermal imaging. They'll survey using the same method again next year to try to determine the change. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We want to try to understand what we can possibly do to save not only the species of bat, not only the bats at this cave, but really bats around the world,” Kloepper said.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:475821840210","fullName":"Wilson

Those efforts have taken on more urgency as the rapid advances of chatbots like ChatGPT highlight benefits the emerging technology can bring — and the new perils it poses.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Here's a look at the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act: \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>HOW DO THE RULES WORK? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>The AI Act, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-government-and-politics-artificial-intelligence-data-privacy-5226382bb316f8aad4cbc5637f03a44c\">first proposed in 2021,\u003c/a> will govern any product or service that uses an artificial intelligence system. The act will classify AI systems according to four levels of risk, from minimal to unacceptable. Riskier applications will face tougher requirements, including being more transparent and using accurate data. Think about it as a \"risk management system for AI,” said Johann Laux, an expert at the Oxford Internet Institute. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT ARE THE RISKS? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>One of the EU's main goals is to guard against any AI threats to health and safety and protect fundamental rights and values. \u003c/p>\u003cp>That means some AI uses are an absolute no-no, such as “social scoring” systems that judge people based on their behavior. AI that exploits vulnerable people including children or that uses subliminal manipulation that can result in harm, such as an interactive talking toy that encourages dangerous behavior, is also forbidden. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawmakers beefed up the proposal by voting to ban predictive policing tools, which crunch data to forecast where crimes will happen and who will commit them. They also approved a widened ban on remote facial recognition, save for a few law enforcement exceptions like preventing a specific terrorist threat. The technology scans passers-by and uses AI to match their faces to a database. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The aim is “to avoid a controlled society based on AI,” Brando Benifei, the Italian lawmaker helping lead the European Parliament's AI efforts, told reporters Wednesday. “We think that these technologies could be used instead of the good also for the bad, and we consider the risks to be too high.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>AI systems used in high risk categories like employment and education, which would affect the course of a person's life, face tough requirements such as being transparent with users and putting in place risk assessment and mitigation measures.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The EU's executive arm says most AI systems, such as video games or spam filters, fall into the low- or no-risk category. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:322051580953\" content-id=\"15ac394679519084478e15217c156abc\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (apf-technology) - Compressed layout \u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT ABOUT CHATGPT? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>The original 108-page proposal barely mentioned chatbots, merely requiring them to be labeled so users know they’re interacting with a machine. Negotiators later added provisions to cover general purpose AI like ChatGPT, subjecting them to some of the same requirements as high-risk systems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One key addition is a requirement to thoroughly document any copyright material used to teach AI systems how to generate text, images, video or music that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/ai-hollywood-writers-strike-artificial-intelligence-dc71c4cabcca0ee1b1afe0050d392a36\">resembles human work\u003c/a>. That would let content creators know if their blog posts, digital books, scientific articles or pop songs have been used to train algorithms that power systems like ChatGPT. Then they could decide whether their work has been copied and seek redress. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHY ARE THE EU RULES SO IMPORTANT? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>The European Union isn't a big player in cutting-edge AI development. That role is taken by the U.S. and China. But Brussels often plays a trendsetting role with regulations that tend to become de facto global standards. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Europeans are, globally speaking, fairly wealthy and there’s a lot of them,\" so companies and organizations often decide that the sheer size of the bloc’s single market with 450 million consumers makes it easier to comply than develop different products for different regions, Laux said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But it's not just a matter of cracking down. By laying down common rules for AI, Brussels is also trying to develop the market by instilling confidence among users, Laux said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The thinking behind it is if you can induce people to to place trust in AI and in applications, they will also use it more,” Laux said. “And when they use it more, they will unlock the economic and social potential of AI.” \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT IF YOU BREAK THE RULES? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>Violations will draw fines of up to 30 million euros ($33 million) or 6% of a company's annual global revenue, which in the case of tech companies like Google and Microsoft could amount to billions. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT’S NEXT?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>It could be years before the rules fully take effect. European Union lawmakers are now due to vote on the draft legislation at a plenary session in mid-June. Then it moves into three-way negotiations involving the bloc’s 27 member states, the Parliament and the executive Commission, where it could face more changes as they wrangle over the details. Final approval is expected by the end of the year, or early 2024 at the latest, followed by a grace period for companies and organizations to adapt, often around two years.

The tests also include the more traditional links to external websites where users can read more extensive information about queried topics. It may take several weeks before Google starts sending invitations to those accepted from the waitlist to test the AI-injected search engine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The AI results will be clearly tagged as an experimental form of technology and Google is pledging the AI-generated summaries will sound more factual than conversational — a distinct contrast from Bard and ChatGPT, which are programmed to convey more human-like personas. Google is building in guardrails that will prevent the AI baked into the search engine from responding to sensitive questions about health — such as, “Should I give Tylenol to a 3-year-old?” — and finance matters.

The new feature will be placed along existing search filters for news, images and video.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Besides using its annual tech showcase to tout its prowess in AI, Google also unveiled the first foldable smartphone in its Pixel line-up of gadgets.
