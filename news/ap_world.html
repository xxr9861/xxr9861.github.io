They created a program, Forest Scientists, to train local high school students in field collection, data systematization, and how to prepare reports.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The initiative is led by Carlos Peres, an Amazon-born professor of tropical conservation ecology at the University of East Anglia, in the United Kingdom. In April this work, begun as an experiment, got some recognition from a Swiss nonprofit when he and three other scientists won the Frontiers Planet Prize, which comes with $1.1 million.

Signing onto a “discharge” petition from the minority is seen as a major affront to party leadership, particularly on an issue as important as the debt ceiling.

But the main problem now, as Biden sees it, is the short time frame from now until the U.S. could default on its debts. It is almost certain to get tangled up in the courts, which would likely push the country beyond June 1, which is when the Treasury Department says the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“We have not come up with a unilateral action that could succeed in a matter of two weeks or three weeks,” \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/debt-ceiling-biden-mccarthy-white-house-ba765d3f34f410fbc8dcdfb2ff67a90f\">Biden told reporters\u003c/a> during a news conference in Hiroshima, Japan, on Sunday as he concluded the Group of Seven summit. “That's the issue.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Biden has viewed the 14th Amendment route as a problematic, untested legal theory to ensure the country can meet its financial obligations.

It has been used by the Supreme Court to mandate racial integration in schools in Brown v. Board of Education and same-sex marriage recognition in Obergefell v. Hodges. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>It also includes this clause, which some legal scholars see as relevant to today's showdown: “The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Default, they argue, is therefore unconstitutional and Biden would have a duty to effectively nullify the debt limit if Congress won't raise it, so that the validity of the country's debt isn't questioned. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHY IS IT BEING TALKED ABOUT NOW?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Congress establishes the limit on borrowing, and it's up to Congress to adjust it. But the president faces pressure to act on his own because some leading Republicans are seeing default, a likely result before long, as an acceptable bargaining tool. That has stoked concerns within the White House that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy might be unable to deliver votes for an agreement to lift the debt limit or could be ousted from his position for even attempting to do so.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those concerns were underscored Wednesday night during a CNN town hall with \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cnn-e-jean-carroll-trial-d3d516c1b66025f635f8685135d35e43\">former President Donald Trump,\u003c/a> the Republican frontrunner in 2024. “If they don’t give you massive cuts, you’re going to have to do a default,” Trump said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The former president said he believes Democrats will “absolutely cave” and a default will be avoided.

The White House and House Republicans, seeking a breakthrough, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-default-biden-mccarthy-spending-cuts-a3103f25ac6772816330f82481388f17\">concluded a round of debt-limit negotiations Sunday\u003c/a>, with plans to resume talks Monday. The Republicans have threatened to let the government default on its debts by refusing to raise the statutory limit on what it can borrow unless President Joe Biden and the Democrats accept sharp spending cuts and other concessions. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>US DEBT, LONG VIEWED AS ULTRA-SAFE\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Feeding the anxiety is the fact that so much financial activity hinges on confidence that America will always pay its financial obligations. Its debt, long viewed as an ultra-safe asset, is a foundation of global commerce, built on decades of trust in the United States. A default could shatter the $24 trillion market for Treasury debt, cause financial markets to freeze up and ignite an international crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A debt default would be a cataclysmic event, with an unpredictable but probably dramatic fallout on U.S. and global financial markets,’’ said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The threat has emerged just as the world economy is contending with a panoply of threats — from surging inflation and interest rates to the ongoing repercussions of Russia's invasion of Ukraine to the tightening grip of authoritarian regimes. On top of all that, many countries have grown skeptical of America’s outsize role in global finance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, American political leaders generally managed to step away from the brink and raise the debt limit before it was too late. Congress has raised, revised or extended the borrowing cap 78 times since 1960, most recently in 2021.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Yet the problem has worsened. Partisan divisions in Congress have widened while the debt has grown after years of rising spending and deep tax cuts. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government could default as soon as June 1 if lawmakers don't raise or suspend the ceiling.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>‘SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE SYSTEM’\u003c/h2>\u003cp>“If the trustworthiness of (Treasurys) would become impaired for any reason, it would send shockwaves through the system ... and have immense consequences for global growth,’’ said Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Treasurys are widely used as collateral for loans, as a buffer against bank losses, as a haven in times of high uncertainty and as a place for central banks to park foreign exchange reserves. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Given their perceived safety, the U.S. government’s debts — Treasury bills, bonds and notes — carry a risk weighting of zero in international bank regulations. Foreign governments and private investors hold nearly $7.6 trillion of the debt — roughly 31% of the Treasurys in financial markets.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Because the dollar's dominance has made it the de facto global currency since World War II, it's relatively easy for the United States to borrow and finance an ever-growing pile of government debt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But high demand for dollars also tends to make them more valuable than other currencies, and that imposes a cost: A strong dollar makes American goods pricier relative to their foreign rivals, leaving U.S. exporters at a competitive disadvantage. That’s one reason why the United States has run trade deficits every year since 1975.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>CENTRAL BANKS' STOCKPILES OF DOLLARS\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Of all the foreign exchange reserves held by the world’s central banks, U.S. dollars account for 58%. No. 2 is the euro: 20%. China’s yuan makes up under 3%, according to the IMF.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers at the Federal Reserve have calculated that from 1999 to 2019, 96% of trade in the Americas was invoiced in U.S. dollars. So was 74% of trade in Asia. Elsewhere outside of Europe, where the euro dominates, dollars accounted for 79% of trade.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>So reliable is America's currency that merchants in some unstable economies demand payment in dollars, instead of their own country’s currency. Consider Sri Lanka, battered by inflation and a dizzying drop in the local currency. Earlier this year, shippers refused to release 1,000 containers of urgently needed food unless they were paid in dollars. The shipments piled up at the docks in Colombo because the importers weren't able to obtain dollars to pay the suppliers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Without (dollars), we can’t do any transaction,” said Nihal Seneviratne, a spokesman for Essential Food Importers and Traders Association. “When we import, we have to use hard currency — mostly the U.S. dollars.’’\u003c/p>\u003cp>Likewise, many shops and restaurants in Lebanon, where inflation has raged and the currency has plunged, are demanding payment in dollars. In 2000, Ecuador responded to an economic crisis by replacing its own currency, the sucre, with dollars — a process called “dollarization’’ — and has stuck with it.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>THE GO-TO HAVEN FOR INVESTORS\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Even when a crisis originates in the United States, the dollar is invariably the go-to haven for investors. That's what happened in late 2008, when the collapse of the U.S. real estate market toppled hundreds of banks and financial firms, including once-mighty Lehman Brothers: The dollar's value shot up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Even though we were the problem — we, the United States — there was still a flight to quality,’’ said Clay Lowery, who oversees research at the Institute of International Finance, a banking trade group. “The dollar is king.’’\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>If the United States were to pierce the debt limit without resolving the dispute and the Treasury defaulted on its payments, Zandi suggests that the dollar would once again rise, at least initially, “because of the uncertainty and the fear. Global investors just wouldn’t know where to go except to where they always go when there’s a crisis and that’s to the United States.’’\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the Treasury market would likely be paralyzed. Investors might shift money instead into U.S. money market funds or the bonds of top-flight U.S. corporations. Eventually, Zandi says, growing doubts would shrink the dollar's value and keep it down.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY IF DEBT CAP IS BREACHED\u003c/h2>\u003cp>In a debt-ceiling crisis, Lowery, who was an assistant Treasury secretary during the 2008 crisis, imagines that the United States would continue to make interest payments to bondholders. And it would try to pay its other obligations — to contractors and retirees, for example — in the order that those bills became due and as money became available.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For bills that were due on June 3, for example, the government might pay on June 5. A bit of relief would come around June 15. That's when government revenue would pour in in as many taxpayers make estimated tax payments for the second quarter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The government would likely be sued by those who weren’t getting paid — “anybody who lives off veterans’ benefits or Social Security,’’ Lowery said. And ratings agencies would likely downgrade U.S. debt, even if the Treasury continued to pay interest to bondholders. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The dollar, though it remains dominant globally, has lost some ground in recent years as more banks, businesses and investors have turned to the euro and, to a lesser extent, China’s yuan. Other countries tend to resent how swings in the dollar's value can hurt their own currencies and economies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A rising dollar can trigger crises abroad by drawing investment out of other countries and raising their cost of repaying dollar-denominated loans. The United States’ eagerness to use the dollar’s clout to impose financial sanctions against rivals and adversaries is also viewed uneasily by some other countries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>So far, though, no clear alternatives have emerged. The euro lags far behind the dollar. Even more so does China’s yuan; it's hamstrung by Beijing’s refusal to let its currency trade freely in global markets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the debt ceiling drama is sure to heighten questions about the enormous financial power of the United States and the dollar.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The global economy is in a pretty fragile place right now,’’ Obstfeld said. “So throwing into that mix a crisis over the creditworthiness of U.S. obligations is incredibly irresponsible.’’\u003c/p>\u003cp>______\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Writer Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, contributed to this

Leaders in Arizona and Nevada didn't immediately say how they'd divide the other 1.4 million acre feet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Imperial Irrigation District would account for more than half of California’s cuts. J.B. Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California, said the district has already taken measures to improve water efficiency and will need to do more.

His victory is widely expected to spur an upgrade of Greece's key credit rating to investment grade, which it lost in 2010.

Instead, he was quickly forced to impose further financial pain in return for a new rescue loan. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, his political future beyond the forthcoming election remains unclear, particulalrly if it confirms the trend set Sunday when Syriza lost about 11 percentage points compared to its showing in 2019.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Pasok leader Androulakis, however, was buoyant, seeing his party claw back some of the ground it lost to Syriza in the crisis — before which it traditionally dominated Greece's center-left. The communist party posted gains, as did a small right-wing anti-immigration party.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Analyst Piccoli said the “devastating blow” suffered by Syriza and the failure of smaller leftwing

Some of the pit toilets still used at more than 3,300 schools in poor, mostly rural areas across South Africa aren't.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's a shameful situation for a country referred to as the most developed in Africa, and an indicator of its profound problems with poverty and inequality, say human rights groups pushing the South African government to do away with the sub-standard facilities in schools forever.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unhygienic, the latrines also present a much more direct danger.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:441632929974' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='b6656a9e00fed0f172177f62837df05f'>Hub peek embed (apf-africa) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>The sight that greeted James Komape one day in January 2014 at the nearby Chebeng village is horrific by every measure.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He'd received a phone call asking him to rush to his 5-year-old son's pre-school. The little boy, Michael, was found dead, drowned at the bottom of a pit latrine. Michael's body hadn't even been removed from the pool of water mixed with feces and urine at the bottom of the pit he fell into when his father got there.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What hurt me a lot about Michael’s incident is that the people who were there saw that he had fallen in the toilet, but they did not remove him,\" said James Komape. “They said they were waiting for the responsible authorities to come and remove him. I told them that if they had removed him quickly maybe he could have survived.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>It was Michael Komape's first week at a new school and his dreadful death incensed many South Africans. His family took the Limpopo province's education department to court and won their case seeking damages. Later, court orders compelled the South African government to urgently address the issue of pit toilets in schools.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the tragedy of Michael Komape has not been unique. Other small children have also drowned in pit latrines in the near-decade since, one girl as recently as last month, another boy in March. There are no reliable figures to say how many children have lost their lives in pit toilets.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The latrines, which have an outlet that is used to drain them periodically, are cheaper and more practical for poorer schools because they don’t rely on a constant supply of running water.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Jupiter Pre-School and Creche in the same Limpopo province where Michael died, children as young as 3 are still using pit toilets that have no proper seat but rather a hole carved out of a concrete slab that opens to the pit below.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“These are not good because of possible accidents of children falling in the toilet,\" the school's manager, Florina Ledwaba, said. “We have to follow them (the children) every time. What if they go without you seeing them? They are not safe at all.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Equal Education human rights group has been inspecting pit toilets in South African schools. Tiny Lebelo, an organizer with the group, expresses frustration over an issue that should be a top priority for government — the safety of children at their schools — and still hasn't been resolved. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The South African government promised to replace all pit toilets at schools nationwide by March 31 this year. It hasn’t happened. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said there are still 3,398 schools using pit latrines and the deadline to eradicate them has been shifted to 2025.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lebelo said “it speaks about how we perceive people in rural areas.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What we are saying about them is that they don't deserve dignity, that's why we're not going to provide you with a basic toilet. We're not going to give that to you because already you've been using it (pit toilets),” she said. “So, what's another year, or two years, or 10, or decades? We're saying to them you're not worthy of dignity.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Section27 is another human rights group pushing for the pit toilets to be eradicated for “safe and decent sanitation facilities.” Section27 supported Michael Komape's family in their legal action against the local and national education departments and they succeeded in getting a court ruling that authorities must provide updated information every six months on schools in the Limpopo province using pit toilets and the plans to replace them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Section27 called its system to track the government's work The Michael Komape Sanitation Progress Monitor and it is able to use the information to hold the education department accountable.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The department has made some progress by reducing schools using pit toilets in Limpopo from 363 in 2021 to 210 schools now. But James Komape said the government hasn't kept its side of an agreement to remove pit toilets and “many children are still in real danger.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the Seipone Secondary School, the pit toilets are officially called ventilation improved toilets, and known as “VIP toilets.” They are anything but. There is anger and now pushback from students, too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Our health also matters, (we) cannot use toilets like these,\" said Tebogo Makgoka, a 17-year-old student

One dramatic exception this year is Ramata-Toulaye Sy, a French-Senegalese filmmaker whose first film, “Banel &amp; Adama,” landed among the 21 films competing for the Palme d'Or. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s only now that I realize that being in competition means being in a competition,” Sy said, laughing, in an interview shortly after “Banel &amp; Adama” premiered in Cannes. “Now that we’re really in the middle of it, I realize there’s a lot of passion going around.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sy, 36, is the sole first-timer in Cannes' main lineup this year.

In their intimate romantic idyll, they wish to pull away from the local traditions. Adama is set to become village chief but is uninterested in doing so. Banel dreams of living outside the village, in a home buried under a mountain of sand. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While Banel and Adama slowly work to sweep away the sand, their yearning to live on their own causes angst in the village, especially when a drought arrives that some take as a curse for their independence. Though often opaque, the film stays largely with the psychology of Banel, whose single-mindedness grows increasingly dark. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I was quite reluctant at the start to acknowledge that Banel is me,” says Sy. “Now I have to confess that it’s definitely me. I see myself, my questions, my struggle in her journey. How to do become an individual inside a community is really my own question.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sy began writing “Banel &amp; Adama” in 2014 as a student at La Fémis, the French film school. Sy, the daughter of Senegalese immigrants, says she was first drawn to literature. Novels like Toni Morrison's “Sula” and Elena Frenate's “My Brilliant Friend” inspired “Banel &amp; Adama.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The love story was a pretext for to deal with myth,” she says. “I wanted to have this kind of mythological female character that you find in Greek tragedy.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sy co-wrote Atiq Rahimi’s “Our Lady of the Nile\" and Çagla Zencirci and Guillaume Giovanetti’s “Sibel” — both of which played at international festivals. Her first short film, “Astel,\" was well-received. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But little prepared her for the stresses of shooting in rural Senegal. Along with heat, sandstorms and bouts of illness among the crew, Sy struggled to find her Banel. In the end, she found Mane while walking around. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We had all the cast except for her. We started five months before shooting and one month before shooting we still didn’t have her. One day I was walking down the street and my eyes locked on this girl,” says Sy. “It was the way that she looked at me. Her gaze had something a bit wise and a bit crazy.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: \u003ca

Did a movie garner a triumphant eight-minute standing ovation? Or did the audience stand for a mere four or five minutes?\u003c/p>\u003cp>How has such an unlikely metric come to reverberate around the world within minutes of a premiere? And why is everyone standing for so long? Doesn't anyone's hands get tired?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such effusive displays of enthusiasm have come to be a hallmark of Cannes and, sometimes, a bit of marketing gimmick for films looking to resonate far from the Croisette. If Cannes, the world's largest and glitziest film festival, stands for cinematic excess, its thunderous standing ovations can seem like its greatest overindulgence. No one needs a bathroom break?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Less widely understood, though, is how the pageantry of Cannes shapes and distorts standing ovations. When audiences rise after the credits roll in the Grand Theatre Lumière, Cannes' biggest screen, they aren't just standing and applauding the movie they just watched.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Immediately after a film wraps, a cameraman swoops in and begins shooting the filmmaker and cast members, who are sitting in the middle of the theater. That video plays live on the screen for everyone inside while the camera — often very patiently — puts each prominent actor in close-up. Applause is only partly for the movie; it's also for each star.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"63f273ece35a43b5a2419fedc0680b85\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/indiana-jones-dial-destiny-cannes-premiere-c94df09d6299a181eb2d713cc1959746\">recently premiered in Cannes,\u003c/a> the camera gave Mads Mikkelsen, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Ethann Isidore, Harrison Ford and director James Mangold each their own moment to bask in adulation. In the end, trade publications — which have reporters inside the theater to keep time — clocked the standing ovation at five minutes. Variety pronounced it \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1659296655114399769?s=20\">a “lukewarm” reception.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Inflation may be such a scourge that it's even affecting standing O's. In most places in the world, a five-minute standing ovation would count as a dream response. In Cannes, it's supposedly as tepid as a day-old espresso.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Reviews for “Dial of Destiny” were, indeed, mixed. But it's also possible that the audience — or the movie's stars — had had enough after a 142-minute movie that was preceded by a much-cheered tribute to Ford. The next day, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/harrison-ford-indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-cannes-film-festival-6ec64a9adf57f2900cb67df89c35e543\">a visibly emotional Ford\u003c/a> called the experience “indescribable.\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The warmth of this place, the sense of community, the welcome is unimaginable,\" said Ford. “And it makes me feel good.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"fa6e40ba2ebd4d049ffa79c3924f8336\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Much of how long a standing ovation endures relates to whether the film's stars push it along or cater to the camera. At the premiere of Martin Scorsese's \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgAmdarluQA\">“Flowers of the Killer Moon,”\u003c/a> after the film's expansive cast had gotten their close-ups, Leonardo DiCaprio and others in the film kept clapping, even when most of the auditorium had stopped. Then, Osage tribe members rallied more life into the applause with loud, celebratory whooping.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Nine minutes was ultimately the call for “Flowers of the Killer Moon,\" enough to mark a high for this year's festival. Scorsese's period epic draw the kind of headlines that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/killers-of-flower-moon-scorsese-cannes-167f0c501a07f14226b0ee9ca2625e23\">every film wants out of Cannes.\u003c/a> Movies don't get second chances for a first impression, after all. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And for those who experience such responses first-hand, it can be deeply emotional. In 2015, Todd Haynes' luminous '50s romance “Carol” launched in Cannes with a 10-minute standing ovation. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t think we put on the poster that there was a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes,” says Christine Vachon, the film's producer. “But when it happens, and a movie is celebrated after a lot of hard work, of course it’s incredibly gratifying.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"92b1550bf48f4aa79d676eaed41de47f\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The longest Cannes ovation on record belongs to Guillermo del Toro's “Pan's Labyrinth,” which scored a 22-minute feting, enough time to watch an episode of “Seinfeld” without the ads. Michael Moore's “Fahrenheit 9/11,\" on its way to winning the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes, was applauded for 20 minutes. Jeff Nichols' “Mud” was cheered for 18 minutes in 2012.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A stopwatch-breaking ovation doesn't always translate to quality. Lee Daniels' “The Paperboy” isn't exactly considered a modern-day classic, but it managed a 15-minute standing O in 2012.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cannes has long been known for its passionate responses. Some hugely revered films, like Francis Ford Coppola's “Apocalypse Now,\" have famously been booed at the festival. But boos are more likely to be heard in the press screenings than the gala formal-attire premieres. At those, a standing ovation is more or less a matter of etiquette.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At this year's festival, the most star-studded films have gone over well. Haynes' “May December,” with Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore, nearly matched the response to his “Carol,” with an eight-minute ovation. Karim Aïnouz's historical drama “Firebrand,” starring Alicia Vikander and Jude Law,\" clocked in with the same. Vikander called the high-decibel roar of the crowd a stirring, unforgettable experience. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was shivering a bit,” Vikander said. “It really gets to you.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv
