But the move could foreshadow more serious developments. Musk has previously accused Microsoft and its partner OpenAI in a tweet of “illegally” using Twitter data to develop sophisticated AI systems such as ChatGPT. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“ \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577\">Lawsuit time\u003c/a>,” Musk wrote in that April tweet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the letter, signed by Musk lawyer Alex Spiro, tiptoed around that concern. It noted that Microsoft's agreement with Twitter barred it from overuse of the service's data such as exceeding “reasonable request volume\" or “excessive or abusive usage.” Spiro then noted that “despite these limitations,” Microsoft had retrieved more than 26 billion tweets in 2022 alone. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:184428044543' class='hub-peek-embed' content-id='292fd9de9cc2623003fd1ce44897c912'>Hub peek embed (ElonMusk) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>He provided no context for those numbers.

For instance, it noted that while Microsoft was required to inform Twitter about its intended use of the data, it failed to do so for six of the eight Microsoft apps that drew on information from the Twitter database. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Similarly, the letter asserted that at least one Microsoft app had supplied Twitter data to a number of virtual locations that “reference a government entity or agency.” That apparently violated Microsoft's agreement with Twitter, the letter stated, which prohibited the company from retrieving Twitter data “on behalf of ‘any government-related entity’” without first notifying Twitter. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The letter stated that Microsoft had failed to provide such notification. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw provided a statement noting that Microsoft will review questions raised by the letter and then will “respond appropriately.” The statement added that “we look forward to continuing our long term partnership” with Twitter, which it did not refer to by name.

Which character do you want to be? Frodo? Gandalf? Legolas? Daedalic Entertainment is betting on a more conflicted protagonist with \u003ca href=\"https://gollumgame.com/\">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum\u003c/a>. Instead of wielding cool weapons and flashy spells, Gollum has to rely on stealth and spiderlike climbing skills to survive. He also has to put up with kibitzing from his alter ego, Smeagol, the kindhearted hobbit Gollum was before being corrupted by his “preciousss” One Ring. The German studio Daedalic is best known for story-heavy adventures like its Deponia series, so it could be interesting to see how it tackles a tale set in J.R.R. Tolkien’s sprawling world. Gollum’s journey begins Friday, May 26, on Xbox X/S/One, PlayStation 5/4 and PC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— In a typical post-apocalyptic video game like Fallout or The Last of Us, there are still plenty of people wandering the planet.

You play as Gaia, the “spirit of life,” and your mission is to gather the lost souls of all the species that have been driven to extinction. Oil-drenched monsters called Devourers are out to stop any hope of revival. Despite the grim setting, After Us looks gorgeous, evoking the haunted wasteland of the 2012 classic Journey. And Barcelona-based Piccolo Studio says it’s a story of “sacrifice and hope,” so Earth may not be done just yet.

Your Lego garage opens for business Friday on PlayStation 5/4, Xbox X/S/One, Nintendo Switch and PC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— “I awoke one morning to find I was a dog” is a heck of a way to open a video game. \u003ca href=\"https://humanity.game/\">Humanity\u003c/a> gets weirder from there. The dog is a glowing Shiba Inu, and his mission is to guide the human masses toward salvation at the end of the world. Sounds heavy, but the result is the sort of hypnotic puzzle game you’d expect from Enhance, the developers responsible for Tetris Effect and Rez Infinite. It’s reminiscent of the 1990s classic Lemmings in that you’re trying to steer crowds of mindless creatures away from a gruesome demise, but once the hordes start fighting each other, this pup’s got a whole new set of problems. With 90-plus levels and the tools for users to build their own, Humanity could last for an eternity. The herding begins Tuesday on PlayStation 5/4 and PC.\u003c/p>\u003cp>— \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/lkesten\">Lou Kesten\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Catch up on AP’s

The law, which isn't scheduled to take effect until Jan. 1, 2024, also faces a litany of questions over whether the state can even enforce the law. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The new rules in Montana will have more far-reaching effects than TikTok bans already in place on government-issued devices in nearly half the states and the U.S. federal government. There are 200,000 TikTok users in Montana as well as 6,000 businesses that use the video-sharing platform, according to company spokesperson Jamal Brown. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"a770d130-ed50-11ed-9b82-312ab640a4b1\" class=\"related-story-embed\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Here’s what you need to know:\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHY IS MONTANA BANNING TIKTOK?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Proponents of the law in Montana claim the Chinese government could harvest U.S. user data from TikTok and use the platform to push pro-Beijing misinformation or messages to the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That mirrors arguments made by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate, as well as the heads of the FBI and the CIA, all of whom have said TikTok could pose a national security threat because its Beijing-based parent company \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-shou-zi-chew-8d8a6a9694357040d484670b7f4833be\">ByteDance\u003c/a> operates under Chinese law.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Critics have pointed to China’s 2017 national intelligence law that compels companies to cooperate with the country’s governments for state intelligence work.

They also contend the state doesn’t have authority over matters of national security. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Montana can no more ban its residents from viewing or posting to TikTok than it could ban the Wall Street Journal because of who owns it or the ideas it publishes,” the complaint said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The people suing include one with a swimwear business, one who connects with military veterans, one who shares videos about ranch life, another who shares her outdoor adventures and one who shares humorous videos.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Emily Flower, spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Justice, said the state expected a legal challenge and it is “fully prepared to defend the law.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>TikTok has argued that the law infringes on people’s First Amendment rights. But spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter declined to comment on the lawsuit and also declined to say whether the company helped coordinate the complaint filed by the TikTok content creators.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The case could serve as a testing ground for the TikTok free America many national lawmakers have envisioned.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>HOW DOES MONTANA PLAN TO BAN TIKTOK?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The law will prohibit downloads of TikTok in the state and fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone accesses TikTok, “is offered the ability” to access it, or downloads it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That means Apple and Google, which operate app stores on Apple and Android devices, would be liable for any violations. Penalties would not apply to users.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The statewide ban won't take effect until January 2024. It would be void if the social media platform is sold to a company that is not based in \"any country designated as a foreign adversary” by the federal government. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The governor indicated he wants to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-montana-bytedance-b735350b367c3f3a0076eaf1267dab18\">expand\u003c/a> the bill to other social media apps in order to address some of the bill’s “technical and legal concerns.” But the legislature adjourned before sending him the bill, which meant he couldn’t offer his amendments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has pointed to technology used to restrict online sports gambling apps as a way to curtail TikTok from operating in the state. Those violations can be reported by anyone. And once the state verifies a breach has taken place, it sends a cease-and-desist letter to the company involved, said Kyler Nerison, a spokesperson for Knudsen's office. He said different companies use different methods for compliance and it's up to them “to not allow their apps to work in Montana and other states where they are not legal.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>SO, COULD THE TIKTOK BAN WORK?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Cybersecurity experts say that, other than avoiding the fine, there's nothing incentivizing the companies involved to comply and it will be extremely difficult — if not impossible — to adequately enforce the law.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For one, the U.S. doesn't have anything equivalent to the type of control \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-internet-service-providers-censorship-beijing-4404eca0bbe14485868bcf6620a6d06a\">countries like China have\u003c/a> on what their citizens access on the web. Compounding that, internet service providers are out of the picture.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before the Montana law passed, lawmakers rewrote portions of the bill to let them off the hook after a lobbyist for AT&amp;T said during a February hearing the legislation was “not workable” to put into effect.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>COULD TECH COMPANIES BLOCK IT?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>Apple and Google have not spoken out against the law. But a representative for TechNet, the trade group that counts the two tech giants as its members, has said app stores don’t have the ability to “geofence” apps in different states and it would be impossible to prevent TikTok from being downloaded in Montana. The group has also said the responsibility should be on an app to determine where it can operate, not an app store.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Telecoms analyst Roger Entner, of Recon Analytics, says he believes the app stores could have the capability to enforce the law, but it would be cumbersome to implement and full of loopholes. Apple and Google’s address-linked billing could be bypassed with prepaid cards and IP geolocation easily masked by using a VPN service, which can alter IP addresses and allows users to evade content restrictions, said mobile security expert Will Strafach, the founder of Guardian, which makes a privacy protection app for Apple devices. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at the cybersecurity firm Check Point, agreed it would be difficult for app stores to isolate a single state from downloading an app. He suggested it would be more feasible for TikTok to comply since it controls the software and can “adjust the settings based on the geographical location or IP addresses\" of users. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>COULD TIKTOK BLOCK ITSELF?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>When users allow TikTok to collect their location information, it can track a person to at least 3 square kilometers (1.16 square miles) from their actual location. If that feature is disabled, TikTok can still collect approximate location information - such as the region, city or zip code in which a user may be located - based on device or network information, like an IP address.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But similar to the app stores, cybersecurity experts note that any enforcement measures the company implements could be easily bypassed with a VPN and efforts to use IP geolocating might lead to other issues. \u003c/p>\u003cp>David Choffnes, the executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University, said cell providers may use the same types of IP addresses for multiple states, which could mean someone who is not in Montana could incorrectly be blocked from using TikTok.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Technology

But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can’t sue the company — just the person who posted it.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>That’s thanks to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>That \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/islamic-state-group-technology-oregon-government-california-paris-3a2122b3456bb232baa5643b70fe676a\">legal phrase shields companies\u003c/a> that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted — whether their complaint is legitimate or not.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Politicians on both sides of the aisle have argued, for different reasons, that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity — or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHERE DID SECTION 230 COME FROM?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The measure’s history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing “obscenity,” which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a “chilling effect” to hold someone liable for someone else’s content.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of “The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,” a book about Section 230.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that “they exercised editorial control — so you’re more like a newspaper than a newsstand,” Kosseff said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That didn’t sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mo-state-wire-social-platforms-ca-state-wire-politics-483752848e144227b53e3c38de5f5e7c\">Section 230 was born\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any claims for moderating content,” Kosseff said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT HAPPENS IF SECTION 230 GOES AWAY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The primary thing we do on the internet is we talk to each other. It might be email, it might be social media, might be message boards, but we talk to each other. And a lot of those conversations are enabled by Section 230, which says that whoever’s allowing us to talk to each other isn’t liable for our conversations,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University specializing in internet law. “The Supreme Court could easily disturb or eliminate that basic proposition and say that the people allowing us to talk to each other are liable for those conversations. At which point they won’t allow us to talk to each other anymore.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” Craigslist quickly removed its “personals” section, which wasn’t intended to facilitate sex work, altogether. But the company didn’t want to take any chances.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump’s lies, defamation, and threats,” said Kate Ruane, former senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union who now works for PEN America.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lowest common denominator prevail.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, a site that was infamous for graphic and extremist content.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Any change to Section 230 is likely to have ripple effects on online speech around the globe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The rest of the world is cracking down on the internet even faster than the U.S.,” Goldman said. “So we’re a step behind the rest of the world in terms of censoring the internet.

Among the apps he listed are WeChat, whose parent company is headquartered in China; and Telegram Messenger, which was founded in Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The legislation, drafted by the attorney general’s office, easily passed through Montana’s GOP-controlled Legislature.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gianforte \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-montana-bytedance-b735350b367c3f3a0076eaf1267dab18\">had wanted to expand the TikTok bill\u003c/a> to include apps tied to foreign adversaries, but lawmakers did not send him the bill until after the session ended this month, preventing him from offering any amendments.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Montana's new law prohibits downloads of TikTok in the state and would fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access the social media platform or download the app. The penalties would not apply to users.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Opponents say Montana residents could easily circumvent the ban by using a virtual private network, a service that shields internet users by encrypting their data traffic, preventing others from observing their web browsing. Montana state officials say geofencing technology is used with online sports gambling apps, which are deactivated in states where online gambling is illegal.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though many lawmakers in Montana have been enthusiastic about a ban, experts who followed the bill closely said the state will likely have to defend the legislation in court.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Officials are also bound to receive criticism from advocacy groups and TikTok users who don’t want their favorite app to be taken away. The app’s fun, goofy videos and ease of use has made it immensely popular, and U.S. tech giants like Snapchat and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, see it as a competitive threat.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>TikTok has been recruiting so-called influencers and small businesses who use the platform to push back on a ban. But others who haven’t been part of an official campaign coordinated by the company are also worried about what lawmakers are doing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adam Botkin, a former football player and recent graduate at the University of Montana, said it was a scary time for him as a content creator in Montana. The 22-year-old has nearly 170,000 followers on TikTok, where he mostly posts short videos of himself performing football kicks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He says he sometimes makes “tens of thousands” of dollars per month from brands looking to market their products on his social media accounts, including Instagram, where he has roughly 44,000 followers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Botkin says most of his income comes from Instagram, which is believed to be more lucrative for content creators. But he has to grow his following on that platform — and others — to have the same level of popularity that he does on TikTok. He says he’s trying to do that and won’t try to circumvent the TikTok ban by using a VPN.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You got to adapt and evolve with how things move,” Botkin said. “So, if I have to adapt and move, I’ll adapt.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Chatter about a TikTok ban has been around since 2020, when then-President Donald Trump attempted to bar the company from operating in the U.S. through an executive order that was \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-entertainment-pennsylvania-courts-3573972d3aa6bee78304e3195ffe4ade\">halted in federal courts\u003c/a>. President Joe Biden’s administration initially shelved those plans, but more recently threatened to ban the app if the company’s Chinese owners don’t sell their stakes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>TikTok doesn’t want either option and has been clamoring to prove it's free of any Chinese government interference. It’s also \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-china-biden-bytedance-data-misinformation-02b59e4a6611ce97c775da19de31d7ad\">touting a data safety plan\u003c/a> it calls “Project Texas” to assuage bipartisan concerns in Washington.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the same time, some lawmakers have emerged as allies, arguing efforts to restrict data harvesting practices need to include all social media companies, not just one. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky blocked a bill in March that would ban TikTok nationally, saying such a move would violate the Constitution and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-ban-congress-hearing-bytedance-china-biden-ceo-a92f048762d6657f291affb7a0ce6386\">anger the millions of voters\u003c/a> who use the app.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Montana’s TikTok ban also comes amid a growing movement to limit social media use among kids and teens and, in some cases, impose bans. Several bills circulating in Congress aim to get at the issue, including one that would prohibit all children under the age of 13 from using social media and require permission from a guardian for users under 18 to create an account.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some states, including \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/social-media-utah-kids-84bd1f6481071726327bce25cf3e7522\">Utah\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/arkansas-facebook-children-social-media-restrictions-c8f14534e2452d8b0f102d6eb17cbe44\">Arkansas\u003c/a>, have already enacted laws that would hinge social media use on parental consent.

Looking through a late loved one’s social media can be both a healthy way to process grief and gather as a community in remembrance, Gabriel said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The prospect of that resource disappearing “can bring about a sense of mourning again,” Gabriel said. “There is a real psychological cost of getting rid of this digital thumbprint that was left behind and this ability for community members to gather in one spot.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>It is unknown if Musk will backtrack on the decision to purge. The billionaire CEO of Tesla has launched policies that have rattled users and advertisers alike and shown little interest in amending those policies in response. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk named a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/twitter-musk-new-ceo-a5df68e9a1e5f982368390c73aeabb50\">new CEO last week\u003c/a>, Linda Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal advertising executive, who will have her hands full with a platform seemingly now in a perpetual state of chaos. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Deleting inactive accounts can be seen as fulfilling a promise Musk made when he bought the company, particularly winnowing down junk accounts and bots, said Samuel Woolley, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>There are good reasons to preserve inactive accounts, and also reasons to delete them, Woolley said, but he is leery of the “one-size-fits-all” approach.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Advocates of purging accounts cite skewed metrics caused by inactive accounts or bogus on social media platforms. Yet on top of emotional pain for some users mourning late loved ones, deleting inactive accounts could also mean losing tweets that documented historical events, commentary and breaking news on the app over the years.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Twitter operates in many ways like a library of data,” Woolley said. “Just because someone hasn’t been active for 30 days or a few years, doesn’t mean their tweets don’t still have a great amount of relevance.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Musk did say the reasoning behind removing inactive accounts was to free up unused Twitter handles, or user names, and that those inactive accounts would be archived. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>What exactly that means is not known — including what inactive accounts will look like when they're archived, and whether they'll be easily accessible. Other details of the plan are also unclear, such as the number of accounts to be removed and whether the policy will be evenly enforced. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While Reed and others saw the inactive accounts of loved ones disappear last week, the account belonging to the late father of controversial internet personality Andrew Tate still appears to be on the site, for example.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Twitter, Tate said he was fine with Musk's decision, but asked that his father's account remain active as he “still (reads) his account daily.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Picking and choosing accounts for deactivation would “create precisely the kind of tiered system that Musk says he wants to avoid,\" Woolley said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When contacted by The Associated Press for comment, Twitter responded with an automated email. Twitter’s trust and safety lead Ella Irwin also did not respond.\u003c/p>\u003cp>According to \u003ca href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts\">Twitter policy\u003c/a>, the social media platform determines an account’s inactivity through log-ins. Twitter says that users should log in at least every 30 days. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Twitter users are able to \u003ca href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20Account%20settings,Your%20account%20from%20the%20menu.&amp;text=Click%20on%20Download%20an%20archive%20of%20your%20data.&amp;text=Enter%20your%20password%20under%20Download,your%20data%2C%20then%20click%20Confirm.\">download an archive\u003c/a> of their own data through the app, but not for accounts they don’t possess login credentials.

Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law, opened the hearing with a recorded speech that sounded like the senator, but was actually a voice clone trained on Blumenthal's floor speeches and reciting ChatGPT-written opening remarks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The result was impressive, said Blumenthal, but he added, “What if I had asked it, and what if it had provided, an endorsement of Ukraine surrendering or (Russian President) Vladimir Putin’s leadership?” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The overall tone of senators' questioning was polite Tuesday, a contrast to past congressional hearings in which tech and social media executives faced tough grillings over the industry's failures to manage data privacy or counter harmful misinformation. In part, that was because both Democrats and Republicans said they were interested in seeking Altman's expertise on averting problems that haven't yet occurred.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Blumenthal said AI companies ought to be required to test their systems and disclose known risks before releasing them, and expressed particular concern about how future AI systems could destabilize the job market.

Co-founded by Altman in 2015 with backing from tech billionaire Elon Musk, the startup has evolved from a nonprofit research lab with a safety-focused mission into a business.

But IBM's Montgomery instead asked Congress to take a “precision regulation\" approach.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We think that AI should be regulated at the point of risk, essentially,” Montgomery said, by

The justices said the law’s definitions exclude Tesla because the company sells its vehicles directly to consumers without using independent franchise dealers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It bears repeating that the Franchise Act regulates the business relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer,” wrote Chief Justice Collins Seitz Jr., adding that nothing in the law or its legislative history supports DMV’s interpretation that the Franchise Act is intended to prohibit the direct sales model.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class='taboola_readmore' data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The court ruling noted that Tesla has fought similar battles in several other states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tesla filed an application with the Delaware DMV for a dealer license in 2019. The DMV subsequently permitted Tesla to open a new car gallery in a shopping mall. The gallery allows customers to view Tesla vehicles, but Tesla cannot sell its cars from an in-state store. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Tesla submitted a second application for a dealer license in 2020. The DMV’s Chief of Compliance and Investigation denied it, noting that Delaware’s Licensing Act for automobile dealers requires that an applicant comply with state law before an application can be granted. The DMV official said Tesla’s application did not comply with the law because the Franchise Act prohibits a vehicle manufacturer from directly or indirectly owning an interest in a dealership or from acting as a dealer. Despite determining that Tesla and its direct-to-consumer sales model did not meet the definition of a “new motor vehicle dealer” under the franchise law, the official concluded that Tesla was still a “manufacturer” under the law.\u003c/p>\u003cp>An administrative hearing officer later agreed that, as a manufacturer, Tesla could not sell new vehicles directly to Delaware consumers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tesla then appealed to the Superior Court, where it lost again. The judge ruled against Tesla even though he agreed that its business model was likely not contemplated by the franchise law. He also found that a Tesla cannot be defined as a “new motor vehicle” because that term applies to a vehicle that has been sold to a dealer. The judge also concluded that Tesla is not a “new motor vehicle dealer” because it does not enter into franchise agreements with third parties.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When the definitions are read together, a ‘manufacturer’ under the Franchise Act manufactures or assembles ‘new motor vehicles’ that have been sold to a ‘new motor vehicle dealer,’” Seitz wrote. “… Tesla’s electric cars will not be sold to a dealer that holds a valid sales contract by Tesla, and therefore it is not a ‘manufacturer.’”\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[{"id":"afs:Reporter:516890743693","fullName":"Randall Chase","displayName":"Randall Chase","biography":null,"twitterId":null,"email":null,"picture":null,"mediumKey":null,"showReporterPage":false,"showReporterBrief":false,"canonicalName":"randall-chase"}],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false,"tagIds":["apf-technology","Electricvehicles","Delaware","apf-business","apf-GeneralNews"],"tagObjs":[{"id":"apf-technology","name":"Technology","canonicalName":"technology","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"CES tech show"},{"id":"Electricvehicles","name":"Electric vehicles","canonicalName":"electric-vehicles","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"Delaware","name":"Delaware","canonicalName":"delaware","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"Bank collapse"},{"id":"apf-GeneralNews","name":"General News","canonicalName":"general-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null}]}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"apf-technology","name":"Technology","canonicalName":"technology","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"CES tech show"},{"id":"apf-business","name":"Business","canonicalName":"business","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":"Bank collapse"},{"id":"Electricvehicles","name":"Electric vehicles","canonicalName":"electric-vehicles","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"Delaware","name":"Delaware","canonicalName":"delaware","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null},{"id":"apf-GeneralNews","name":"General News","canonicalName":"general-news","isPr":false,"isSuppressed":false,"navigationShortName":null}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"olympicYear":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null,"displayPositionHome":null,"displayPositionApp":null,"featuredCard":null,"publishedDate":"2023-05-15 22:25:39","enableTblRegion":false,"widgetCard":null}]}},"loadedAt":{"/technology":1684793013517},"expiration":120000},"card":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{},"loadedAt":{},"expiration":120000},"content":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{},"loadedAt":{},"expiration":120000},"medium":{"loading":{},"error":{},"data":{"76675d66f3fe43cc8c82f84cebd19738":{"id":"76675d66f3fe43cc8c82f84cebd19738","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - The icon for the video sharing TikTok app is seen on a smartphone, Feb. 28, 2023, in Marple Township, Pa.
